By introducing a focus on motion verbs, we integrate dynamic semantics into a rich formal model of events to generate animations in real time that correlate with human conceptions of the event described. This paper presents a working system that generates these animated scenes over a test set, discussing challenges encountered and describing the solutions implemented.",
